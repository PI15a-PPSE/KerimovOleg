This project is a simple browser based implementation of the classic board game, Go, using HTML5 and JavaScript.

Only game logic and some debugging tools were developed, which means pre- and post-game state handling isn't included.


Instructions
------------

To run, launch [index.html] or [lite.html] in your browser.

 * [index.html] is the HTML5 version.
 * [lite.html] is a text based version, which also allows you to configure board size.

Notes
-----

 * The plan was also to keep View related files in subfolders, which was done partially for the Touch view, but never completed.

 * Google Chrome is the only tested browser, although things may work in other browsers as well.
